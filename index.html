<h2><a id="About_4"></a>About</h2>
<p>Hack K-state kicks off November 11’16 giving 48 hours to anyone interested in coding a chance to display their skills and creativity. The event is meant to bring together engineers, business students, designers, entrepreneurs etc from different disciplines. Starting 2016, Hack Kstate includes Data Science for Social Good(DSSG) track. DSSG uses analysis and visualization of data on topics such as public health, sustainable urban planning, environmental protection, disaster response, crime prevention, education, transportation, governance, commerce, social justice etc. that impact the lives of local community. This is the <code>first ever data science hackathon</code> organized at Kansas State University.</p>
<h2><a id="Why_data_science_7"></a>Why data science?</h2>
<p>Data science is art of deriving meaning from data by understanding how it fits into the larger picture of a society or organization. It utilizes cross discipline skills in Computer Science, business, analytics, statistics, and mathematics.  By 2020 the world will generate 50x the amount of information compared to 2011 [<a href="http://EMC.com">EMC.com</a>]. As per McKinsey Global Institute, The U.S. could face a shortage of up to 190,000 professionals with data science skills by 2018. Data Science highly in demand skill set is applicable to companies in almost all domains of life. This event helps you learn these skills and but also put them directly in use.</p>
<h2><a id="Theme_for_2016__Healthcare_11"></a>Theme for 2016 : Healthcare</h2>
<p>This year’s DSSG theme is healthcare. Healthcare has slowly been progressing through three waves of data : data collection, data sharing, and data analytics.  Today, there is a huge volume of health data from pharmaceutical, biotech and healthcare organization. It is a challenge to derive  meaningful value from this data. Healthcare analytics is about  understanding real-world healthcare data and finding a creative solutions that would hav an impact on healthcare. At Hack K-state you will get a chance to do it all, in an intense 48 hour competition.</p>
<h2><a id="Event_Details_15"></a>Event Details</h2>
<p>Hack K-State 2016 kicks off on <code>Friday, November 11, 2016 at 7:30pm</code> with opening presentation at Fiedler Auditorium. The competition officially begins at 9:00 pm. For more details please visit : <a href="https://hackkstate.org/schedule/schedule.pdf">https://hackkstate.org/schedule/schedule.pdf</a></p>
<p>We will host two categories under the data science for social good (DSSG) track:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Novice:</strong> Are you looking for an opportunity to learn skills at Data Science? This category is a perfect for you. We have different resource where you can learn skills needed to be a data scientist. Also we offere 3 datasets under <strong>Challenge #3</strong> that will help you implement this knowledge.</li>
<li><strong>Experts:</strong> Regression, Classification, Bayesian or SVM, do these words sound very familiar? If yes, this category is perfect for you. If you have some programming background and have worked with any form of data problem in past we encourage you to participate under this category. You can chose from <strong>Challenge #1</strong> or <strong>Challenge #2</strong>.</li>

<h4><a id="Challenge_1__Predicting_Hospital_Readmissions_25"></a>Challenge #1:  Predicting Hospital Readmissions</h4>
<p>In this challenge, your team will try to predict which patients will be re-admitted to the hospital after being discharged from a hospital stay.  This is a real problem for hospitals, who don't get paid for a re-admission if it happens within 30 days after the patient was discharged. You will be given a training data set of several files, and will need to assemble them and train your algorithm.  You are free to use any algorithm you wish that your team codes, or combine several. On Sunday at 9:00 AM, we will release the validation data set. You will run your algorithm and submit your predictions for who got re-admitted from validation data set.<br>
<strong>Data Description :</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Training Set:</strong>  This file (Challenge_1_Training.Set.csv) contains HIPAA compliant de-identified records of hospital admissions.  Each record contains a random and one-way scrambled unique identifier, limited demographics (age, gender), type of admission,  discharge disposition (e.g. home, to a skilled nursing facility, home with assistance, transfer to another facility), if the person was re-admitted, and the number of days from the relative to 30 that the re-admission occurred. The (READ_ME.doc) file contains each field definition, as well as additional definitions for Admission Type (admission_type_id.csv), Discharge Disposition (discharge_disposition_id.csv), and Admission Source (admission_source_id.csv)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Look-up tables for ICD-9 Diagnosis:</strong>  This zipped files (version 32) from <a href="https://www.cms.gov/medicare/coding/ICD9providerdiagnosticcodes/codes.html">Center for Medicare Services web site </a> contains two tables with the ICD-9 Diagnosis (CMS32_DESC_LONG_DX.txt) and also Procedure (CMS32_DESC_LONG_SG.txt) Codes.  The ICD-9 Diagnosis tables provide a description of the numerical Diagnosis codes contained in the Challenge_1_Training.Set.csv file.  You can use this file if you want to understand the codes and/or deepen your analysis of re-admission causes.</p>

<h4><a id="Challenge_2_DocGraph_Provider_Community_Identification"></a>Challenge #2: DocGraph Provider Community Identification</h4>
<p>In this challenge, your team will use clustering methods and network science methods to identify "teams" of Medicare providers linked to each other by shared patients in the state of New York State (NYS).  You will use a subset of a publicly available Medicare data sets that contain only NYS providers (doctors, organizations, nurse practitioners, physician's assistants, etc.).  You will need to link this data set to another file that contains information about each provider specialty as well as, a table containing geolocation coordinates of the provider at the zip code level.  You should identify closely linked teams of providers, and figure out their characteristics (team composition, etc.) and any other interesting features of how they are connected.  To accomplish this challenge, you will also need to display your results using innovative graphics.</p>
<p><strong>Data Description :</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Docgraph File:</strong>  This is a subset of the entire United Sates file created by Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) in response to a Freedom if Information (FOI) request by Fred Trotter at DocGraph. This Challenge_2_referral_data.txt (compressed) data set contains which New York State (NYS) providers shared patients in 2013. This is a way of identifying physician teaming and looking at how patterns of physician groups or teams, work together.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NYS Provider Identifier File:</strong>  CMS has developed the National Plan and Provider Enumeration System (NPPES) to assign unique identifiers to health care providers. These National Provider Identifiers or NPI Numbers are required for reimbursing healthcare providers for services from CMS. The (compressed) Challenge_2_npi_lookup_data.txt data set is a NYS subset of the National file and contain all of the FOIA-disclosable data for active and deactivated healthcare providers.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Provider Specialty Codes:</strong> The provider identifier file contains codes for provider specialty, this Challenge_2_Prov_Taxonomy_1_1_13.csv data set is a crosswalk for the declared specialty of providers in the above 2 tables.
See the Challenge_2_READ_ME.doc table for a description of the above table</p>
